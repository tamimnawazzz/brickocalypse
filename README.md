**🎮 Core Gameplay**

🚀 How to Play
Collect scattered tower pieces and bring them to the tower center. Shoot or avoid zombies while carrying blocks. Defend your tower from zombies (they destroy blocks if they touch it). Use power-ups to survive longer. Reach the target tower height to win!

Tower Building – Collect pieces scattered in the arena and stack them to grow your central tower.

Zombie Attacks – Endless waves of zombies constantly move toward you and the tower.

Tower Defense – If a zombie touches the tower, it destroys one layer, reducing your progress.

Height Goal – Reach a specific tower height to win the game.

Player Survival – Avoid zombies yourself; if they catch you, you lose health points.



**⚙️ Mechanics & Progression**

Resource Gathering – Search for and carry building pieces back to the tower center.

Stack Physics – Each placed block adds realistic tower height.

Increasing Difficulty – Zombie waves grow stronger and faster over time (through upgrades).

Power-Ups – Spawn randomly every 10s, lasting for 10s:

🟡 Yellow Orb – Faster player speed

🔵 Blue Orb – Increased gun magazine

🔴 Red Orb – Slows enemies

Day/Night Cycle – Every 30s:

☀️ Day: Full arena visibility (TPP)

🌙 Night: Only 1/8th of arena visible (TPP)

🧟 Zombie Types

Normal Zombie (Red) – Standard speed and damage.
